In this code/ directory, you'll find various scripts, tests, and functions, along with our test-that.R file which can be called to run the tests in tests/ on the functions in functions/. In the functions/ directory, we have the .R file which contains all of our regression functions which we created to be called upon in our report, to clean up the potential clutter of the .Rmd file. We test these functions with the unit tests laid out in the tests/ directory, using the testthat R package. Finally, in the scripts/ directory, we have the meat of our project: our exploratory data analysis script, which we used to collect and save intermediary data and models, and our regression script, which we used to carry out simple and multiple linear regression on our data set. These scripts have output in a variety of our folders, and all of our analysis stems from these scripts. We also have a session info script, which displays the nuances of the machine which I am using to allow you insight into further questions of reproducibility between operating systems, as well as what packages, etc. I was using.
