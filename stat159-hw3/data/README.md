In this directory you'll find our various intermediary data sets. First, we have the Advertising.csv data set, upon which all of our analysis was built upon, generously open-source for all to use from **ISLR**. We automate the downloading of this in our makefile. You'll find a few .RData sets which we read in in our report, data which was calculated in our scripts but would not be logical to calculate and derive in a report setting. We thus have our correlation matrix and some various regression data which are used to make tables in our report. We also have some exploratory data statistical analysis, in which we include some basic summary statistics of each of the variables to shine light onto our model and its predictors.
